# Spring Sessions with Redis and Spring Security

Welcome to the Spring Sessions demo project, showcasing the integration of Spring Sessions, Redis, and Spring Security for efficient and secure session management.

## Project Overview

This simple project demonstrates how to leverage Spring Sessions to manage user sessions in a distributed environment using Redis as the backend storage. Additionally, it incorporates Spring Security for basic authentication.
I have implemented a simple controlled that will be able to track the user's session by incrementing a simple home view count.

## Features

- **Spring Sessions:** Utilize Spring Sessions to manage user sessions across multiple servers.
- **Redis Integration:** Store and retrieve session data using Redis as a distributed caching solution.
- **Spring Security:** Implement basic authentication and secure endpoints using Spring Security.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-sessions-redis-security-demo.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Configure Redis connection properties in `application.properties`.
4. Run the application.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.
